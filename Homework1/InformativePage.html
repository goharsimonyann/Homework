            <p><big><b><i>Machu Picchu</i></b> is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the <i>Eastern Cordillera</i> of southern Peru 
                on a 2,430-meter mountain ridge.The Urubamba River flows past it, cutting through the Cordillera and

            <img src="Canyon_River_Tree_(165872763).jpeg" alt="The Grand Canyon, Arizona" width="40%">
            <p><big><b><i>Grand Canyon</i></b>, one of the seven natural wonders of the world, is in the U.S. state of Arizona. 
                It's one of those beautiful places for which photos or video just don't do it justice-its sheer size and 
                scope is hard to comprehend.

            <li><big>Rome, Italy</big></li>
            <img src="Hero_RomeItaly.jpg" alt="Rome, Italy" width="40%">
            <p><big>The Eternal City is more like a giant, living museum. Visitors are immersed in and surrounded by thousands 
                of years of history. It's a relatively compact city, and a three-day itinerary gets you to the minimum number 
                of must-see places.

            <li><big>Maui, Hawaii</big></li>

                rainforest in the <i>West Maui Mountains</i>. The natural scenery is amazing-it's truly one of the most beautiful islands in the 
                world.
